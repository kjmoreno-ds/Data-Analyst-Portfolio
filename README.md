# Project 1: Animal Shelter EDA
* Created a .py file that cleans the data upon import using the file path
* Engineer features from the text of each animal to categorize animals based on their Sex, Spay/Neutered/Intact, Adoption Status, Euthanasia Status, Time at the Shelter, and age at Intake and Outcome
* Used a Google API to extract geocodes for the location of stray animals
